# An End-to-End TextSpotter with Explicit Alignment and Attention

This is initially described in our [CVPR 2018 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03474).

## Getting Started
### Installation
- Clone the code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tonghe90/textspotter
cd textspotter
```

- Install caffe. You can follow this [this tutorial](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html). 
If you have build problem about std::allocater, please refer to [this #3](https://github.com/tonghe90/textspotter/issues/3)
```bash
# make sure you set WITH_PYTHON_LAYER := 1
# change Makefile.config according to your library path
cp Makefile.config.example Makefile.config
make clean
make -j8
make pycaffe
```


- install editdistance and pyclipper: `pip install editdistance` and  `pip install pyclipper`

- After Caffe is set up, you need to download a trained model (about 40M) from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lzM-V1Ec8KHr8fKxeO_d1x3zFaj3bmnU). This model
  is trained with [VGG800k](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/scenetext/) and finetuned on [ICDAR2015](http://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=4&com=introduction).
- Run `python test.py --img=./imgs/img_105.jpg`

- hyperparameters:

```
cfg.py --mean_val ==> mean value during the testing.
       --max_len ==> maximum length of the text string (here we take 25, meaning a word can contain 25 characters at most.)
       --recog_th ==> the threshold during the recognition process. The score for a word is the average mean of every character.
       --word_score ==> the threshold for those words that contain number or symbols for they are not contained in the dictionary.

test.py --weight ==> weights file of caffemodel
        --prototxt-iou ==> the prototxt file for detection.
        --prototxt-lstm ==> the prototxt file for recognition.
        --img ==> the folder or img file for testing. The format can be added in ./pylayer/tool is_image function.
        --scales-ms ==> multiscales input for input during the testing process.
        --thresholds-ms ==> corresponding thresholds of text region for multiscale inputs.
        --nms ==> nms threshold for testing
        --save-dir ==> the dir for save results in format of ICDAR2015 submition.
```

```
One thing should be noted: the recognition results are achieved by comparing direct output with words in dictionary, which has about 90K lexicons. 
These lexicons don't contain any number and symbol. You can delete dictionary reference part and directly output recognition results.
